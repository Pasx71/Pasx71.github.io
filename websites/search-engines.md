# Useful Search Engines

Here are some search engines I use:

*   **[Google](https://google.com)**: The standard, comprehensive.
*   **[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)**: Privacy-focused alternative. Good "bangs" for quick searches.
*   **[Wikipedia Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Searching)**: Excellent for encyclopedic information.
*   **[WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com)**: Computational knowledge engine. Great for facts, calculations, data.

## Tips

*   Learn search operators (`site:`, `filetype:`, quotes `""`)
*   Try different engines for different tasks.
