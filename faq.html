        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How long does the quiz take to complete?</h3>
            <p>The quiz consists of 145 questions. Most people complete it in approximately 15-25 minutes. Please take your time to answer thoughtfully.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Are my results and answers saved?</h3>
            <p>No. The ArcheMorph quiz runs entirely in your web browser. Your answers and results are not sent to any server or stored after you close the page. If you want to keep your results, please use the "Save as PDF / Print" option or take screenshots.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can my ArcheMorph type change over time?</h3>
            <p>Personality can be relatively stable but also has room for development and change, especially in response to significant life experiences or conscious effort. While core traits might be enduring, how you express them or how certain factors manifest can evolve. Retaking the quiz after a significant period or life change might yield different insights.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What if I score "Moderate" on many traits?</h3>
            <p>Scoring moderately on several traits is quite common and indicates a balanced or flexible approach in those areas. The results page will highlight these nuances and may suggest alternative ways your archetype components could be expressed, reflecting your adaptability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is this quiz scientifically validated?</h3>
            <p>The ArcheMorph system is inspired by established psychological research and constructs (like the Big Five, motivational styles, etc.). However, this specific combination and the resulting archetypes are unique to this system and are intended for self-exploration and insight, not as a scientifically validated psychometric instrument for clinical or diagnostic purposes. Please see our "About" page for a full disclaimer.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How are the archetype names generated?</h3>
            <p>The 4-part archetype name is generated based on your dominant tendencies across different groups of personality factors. Each part of the name (Prefix, Core, Suffix, Qualifier) corresponds to a set of traits. You can learn more on the "Explore Archetypes" and "Understand Factors" pages.</p>
