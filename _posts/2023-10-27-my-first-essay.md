## Welcome!

This is the start of my collection of random essays. I plan to write about various topics that interest me.

Using Jekyll and GitHub Pages makes it really easy to publish content just by writing Markdown files like this one.

### Markdown is Cool

You can use standard Markdown features:

*   Bullet points
*   **Bold** and *italic* text
*   [Links](https://github.com)
*   `Inline code`

```python
# Code blocks too!
print("Hello, Jekyll!")
