        <h2>About the ArcheMorph System</h2>
        <p>The ArcheMorph system is designed as a tool for self-exploration and understanding the multifaceted nature of personality. It draws inspiration from various established psychological constructs, including the Big Five personality traits, motivational theories, attachment styles, and other relational dynamics to create a unique 4-part archetype name.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to provide users with a nuanced perspective that goes beyond simple labels, highlighting how different traits interact to form a complex whole. The system encourages reflection on one's tendencies, cognitive styles, driving forces, and interpersonal patterns.</p>
