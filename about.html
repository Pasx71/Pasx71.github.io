        <h2>About the ArcheMorph Personality System</h2>
        <p>
            ArcheMorph is a next-generation, multidimensional personality classification system that integrates and expands 
            upon the core ideas of major existing personality frameworks (such as MBTI, Big Five, DISC, Enneagram, HEXACO, and more). 
            It combines a rich set of fundamental psychological traits and behavioral tendencies into a comprehensive, nuanced model.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>
            We believe that understanding personality is a journey, not a destination. Traditional systems often provide valuable but limited snapshots. 
            ArcheMorph aims to offer a more dynamic and detailed map, helping individuals appreciate their complexities and potentials. 
            By measuring 16 core axes and synthesizing this information into a unique 4-part archetype name, we provide both depth 
            of insight and a memorable way to understand and communicate one's personality profile.
        </p>
        <h3>The Science (Conceptual)</h3>
        <p>
            The 16 axes measured by ArcheMorph are derived from a synthesis of established psychological constructs,
            covering areas like core temperament, cognitive styles, motivational drives, and interpersonal patterns,
            including more complex relational dynamics and self-perception facets.
            The system is designed to be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>More Granular:</strong> Instead of 4 or 5 broad traits, it measures 16 distinct dimensions.</li>
            <li><strong>Modular and Combinatorial:</strong> Personality is expressed as a fusion, reflected in the 4-part name.</li>
            <li><strong>Evocative and Memorable:</strong> Using carefully chosen archetype names to capture complex profiles.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible and Extensible:</strong> The underlying model can evolve with new research.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The ArcheMorph quiz (when available) will guide you through a series of questions designed to assess your leanings on these 16 axes. 
            Our algorithm then synthesizes these scores to generate your unique archetype name and a detailed report, 
            including an explanation of each part of your name, your trait scores, and insights into how these aspects of your 
            personality might interact.
        </p>
