        <h2>The 16 Core Traits Measured by ArcheMorph</h2>
        <p>

            You will need to dynamically generate this list from your config.py (ALL_SCORABLE_AXES_DEFINITIONS)
            and trait_blurbs.py (TRAIT_DESCRIPTIONS).
            For now, here's a placeholder for how one item would look:
